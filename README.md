# 🐧 Penguins of the Desert 🌵

Welcome to **Penguins of the Desert**, the coolest spot in the hottest places! 🎉 This is where we dive deep into the sands of the internet to bring you an oasis of content, hidden away from the prying eyes of the surface web. Ready to explore? Let's dive in! 🚀

## What's This All About? 🤔

Penguins of the Desert is a website hosted on the Tor network. Why? Because privacy is key, and we believe in the power of the internet to be free and open for all, minus the surveillance. It's a space where we can share, learn, and connect, all under the radar. 🕶️

## Getting Started 🏁

To access our hidden oasis, you'll need to take a few steps. Don't sweat, we've got you covered with the deets right here.

### Step 1: Enter the Matrix (The Tor Network) 🌐

1. **Download Tor Browser**: Head over to [the Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/) and download the Tor Browser for your operating system. This is your key to the hidden parts of the internet.
2. **Install Tor Browser**: Run the downloaded file and follow the instructions to install it. Easy peasy!

### Step 2: Deploy Penguins of the Desert 🐧🏜️

Want to run your own version of Penguins of the Desert on the Tor network? Here's how to set up your own .onion hidden service:

1. **Get the Code**: Clone this repo to your local machine. Use `git clone` followed by the URL of this repo. Got it? Cool, let's move on.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. run `pip install django` to get set up.
3. **Configure Tor**: Open your Tor Browser's Tor configuration file (`torrc`) and add the following lines to set up a new hidden service:
    ```
    HiddenServiceDir /path/to/your/hidden_service/directory
    HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:YOUR_WEBSERVER_PORT
    ```
    Replace `/path/to/your/hidden_service/directory` with the path where you want your hidden service's keys to be stored, and `YOUR_WEBSERVER_PORT` with the port number your web server is running on.
4. **Restart Tor**: For the changes to take effect, restart your Tor service. This varies by operating system, but generally, you can just close and reopen the Tor Browser.
5. **Launch Your Site**: Start your web server if it's not already running. Your site should now be accessible via a .onion URL that you'll find in the `hostname` file in your hidden service directory.

### Step 3: Visit Us 🚀

To visit the official Penguins of the Desert site, just fire up Tor Browser and navigate to our .onion URL (you didn't think we'd forget, did you?). Here it is:
